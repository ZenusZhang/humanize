# Agent Instructions

- After completing requested changes and running relevant validation, automatically create a git commit unless the user explicitly asks not to commit.
- After creating the commit, automatically push to the user's repository at `https://github.com/ZenusZhang/humanize.git` unless the user explicitly asks not to push.
- Use branch `main` by default when pushing, unless the user specifies a different branch.
- Write clear, specific commit messages that describe the actual change set.

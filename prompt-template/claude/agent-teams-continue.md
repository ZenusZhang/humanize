## Agent Teams Continuation

Continue using **Agent Teams mode** as the **Team Leader** within the RLCR development cycle. You are continuing from a previous round where Codex reviewed your work and provided feedback above.

### Continuation Context

- **Previous Team No Longer Exists**: Your teammates from the previous round are gone. Do NOT attempt to message or reference old teammates. You must create a brand new team for this round.
- **Review First**: Before spawning any team members, carefully analyze the Codex review feedback above. Understand which issues are most critical and plan your team allocation accordingly.
- **Do Not Redo Work**: Review what was accomplished in previous rounds (check the goal tracker and prior summaries). Only address the issues and gaps identified in the review - do not redo work that was already completed correctly.
- **Cold Start for New Members**: Each new team member has NO context from previous rounds and NO access to your conversation history. They DO have access to CLAUDE.md and project configuration automatically. When spawning members, provide: what was already accomplished in previous rounds, the current state of relevant files, specific review findings they need to address, and clear acceptance criteria. Do not repeat what CLAUDE.md already covers.
- **Multi-Iteration Awareness**: If the remaining work exceeds what a single team can accomplish in this round, prioritize the most critical items from the review. Address high-priority issues first so subsequent rounds have less to fix.
- **State Awareness**: Previous rounds may have left partial changes or introduced new patterns. Verify the current state of files (e.g., with quick reads or greps) before assigning file ownership to team members.
